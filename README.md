Modelling the heating and energy load based on building parameters 

12 different building shapes are used in the simulation using Ecotet. The heating and cooling energy loads are recorded for each of the combination of 8 different structural variables. 
We have two goals : one to model the heat and cooling energy loads using different machine learning algorithms .
and second , try and find the optimal parameters for minimal heat and energy load.
